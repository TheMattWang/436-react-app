# Running this App #

## Running the front end ##

Please install all the node modules in the frontend through node install. This is accomplished through npm install. Then just run npm start and it'll be open on port 3000.


## Running the back end ## 
Please pip install flask and pip install flask-cors. Also please replace the api_key with your api_key as it is now deprecated and no longer in use. Then in a seperate terminal just run python app.py and the backend will be running.
